**From your experience working with various data sets, models, and frameworks, what would be the ultimate dataset, or datasets that you would like to see from the Economy Data Observatory?**  

**What is an idea that you consider will be a game changer for researchers and/or policymakers?**

<optional: Do you have a favorite, or most used open governmental or open science data source? What do you think about it?  Could it be improved?>

**Is there a number <piece of information as data> that recently surprised you? If so, what was it?**

I recenly learned that [more people are smoking](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/may/27/number-of-smokers-has-reached-all-time-high-of-11-billion-study-finds) tobocco on Earth in 2021 then in 1990. It is very easy to forget that the world population is still fast growing, and the composition is very different from the time when we were born.  Population growth in developing countries replaced the shrinking number of developed country smokers.

This reminded me to a short video of the late Hans Rosling, founde of Gapminder, and probably the most influential data educator of the 21st century. He explains with his usual sense of humor, how much Mexico has changed since Donald Trump left schools and last learned about the country behind the border wall in  [The Mexico - US Race - Factpod #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foXlFILJCgk&t=45s). Most people get their social and geographical trivia knowledge in primary and secondary school, maybe at university, and those memories stick as they grow older, or they are not systematically updated.  I live in the Netherlands, where you hardly see people smoking, I do not smoke, and even my parents quit smoking. But that does not mean that there are no new smokers worldwide.

One great source to update your knowledge about the world is [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/smoking). We hope to produce datasets in our observatories that are at least as good as theirs, and may even be re-used by them, as we keep them open.


**<optional: Do you have a good example of really good, or really bad use of data science / data curation?>**

**What do you see as the greatest challenge with open data in 2021?**

There was a famous bon mot in economics: a neoclassical economist would never pick up a a hundred dollar bill on the street. In an efficient market, it would be already picked up if it was not counterfeit.  Many people believe that open data does not contain any competitive advanatages, it is public, and if it was worthy to exploit, it would be already exploited.  But this is far from the truth. Most open data is not public, it is just legally open. It has to be re-processed for re-use, a new documentation must be made, and the data must be thoroughly vetted and validated.  This is what we do in with our statistical software and with our data-as-service in the observatories. But the value of open data is immense, each year the EU and its member states place tens of billions euros worth data at historical cost to silos that can be legally opened.  And the same is true for reproducible scientific output, which is placed on repositories like Zenodo or Dataverse.  We try to systematically exploit these sources, very much like the open source intelligence data sleuths of Bellingcat do with other types of openly available data.


**How do you envision the Economy Data Observatory making open data more credible in the European economic policy community and accepted as verified information?**
